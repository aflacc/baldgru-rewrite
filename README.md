this is a __*full*__ rewrite of the mod.. It now runs on 0.7.3 Psych Engine.. and deals with all of the struggles that Psych engine has... *sigh*

You can run the setup file located in.. the `./setup/` folder... I mean I think that was obvious, though it does require you to have looked at the repo. Which is like,, if you wanted to compile it I would assume you've looked..

if you're here to just read something interesting, you can read commit descriptions. I tried to write descriptions on every commit

if theres bugs discovered feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/aflacc/baldgru-rewrite/issues) and I might do something about it

the file `SAVE.zip` is a save file that *only* has the main story week and yolked completed, you can use it by copying the save file to your `%appdata%` (Roaming) folder! make sure it is in the format of `./aflac/baldgru/(...)` and it *should* just let you create save data that skips the freeplay unlock. That's all I did with that save! I didn't mess with any settings (I think).
