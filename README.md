this is a __*full*__ rewrite of the mod.. It now runs on 0.7.3 Psych Engine.. and deals with all of the struggles that Psych engine has... *sigh*

Do you want a Bald Gru v2 Teaser? Here you go: We're switching engines.

You can run the setup file located in.. the `./setup/` folder... I mean I think that was obvious, though it does require you to have looked at the repo. Which is like,, if you wanted to compile it I would assume you've looked..

if you're here to just read something interesting, you can read commit descriptions. I tried to write descriptions on every commit

if theres bugs discovered feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/aflacc/baldgru-rewrite/issues) and I might do something about it
