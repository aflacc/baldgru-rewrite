sometimes songs glitch out on start and sound really choppy. if that happens just restart the song and that should fix it

theres also a video that plays in one song that is super inconsistant and sometimes takes too long to load, or sometimes just crashes the game immediately. if that happens im really really sorry, i do not know why it does this.. video cutscenes in general are kind of buggy in this build im sorry
